                                I don't think I'd be where am at now professionally if it wasn't for the education I 
                                received at Harbour Space. To produce your best work as a designer you have to be
                                (1) Surrounded by ambitious peers striving to create great work (2) Receive guidance
                                and instruction from practitioners that will push you beyond your comfort zone -
                                Harbour Space did that for me and I'm forever grateful for the experience I had as
                                a student there.

                                modules. Quitting my job and moving to Barcelona was one of the best decisions I’ve made. 
                                I would recommend Harbour.Space to anyone who is open to challenging themselves.

                                What a great year!
                                Having done my Bachelors at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, it was a 
                                hard decision for me to come to Barcelona and study at Harbour.Space. However, 
                                after one year I can say that it was more than worth it.
                                I have learned a lot about how to set up a company, heavily extended my network 
                                with decision-makers, met incredible classmates from all over the world and also 
                                learned 3 new programming languages (without being a data / computer science 
                                student)
                            </p>

                                Wow! What an enriching educational experience! 
                                Coming from a journalism background in South Africa, I was interested in how to use interactive media to tell better stories. 
                                After learning from the best of the best, from creative geniuses from all around the world and constantly being pushed to improve 
                                and grow, I found my calling. Harbour.Space is the experience of a lifetime with unforgettable people and is well worth a shot.

                            <p>Harbour.Space will assist students in finding the most optimal mentor for the Capstone Project but is not responsible for the outcome. 
                            Please note that mentors are not assigned but are instead courted. As a rule, it will take a while to convince the best mentors to become advisors on your project. 
                            The more developed the project is when the mentor is contacted, the higher the chances of success. 
                            Every member of our teaching faculty can become a mentor based on their past experiences, so be conscious about this while taking courses, 
                            and impress visiting faculty with your work ethics, passion and commitment.</p>
